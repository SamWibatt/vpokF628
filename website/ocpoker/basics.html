	<h1>Video Poker: the Basics</h1>
	<p>This page is for those unfamiliar with video poker. If you already
	know the game pretty well, you can get started with the details by
	clicking the &ldquo;next&rdquo; link at the top or bottom right.</p>
	<p>There are several variations on video poker. This implementation
	is one known as Jacks or Better. It doesn't have any wild cards or
	other oddities - such features are left as an exercise to the reader.
	If anyone comes up with a variant like that, I'd be thrilled to <a
	 href="../contact.html">hear
	about it</a>.</p>
	<h2>The very very basics</h2>
	<p>Video Poker, in this implementation and many found in actual
	casinos, uses a single 52-card deck which is shuffled before every
	game.</p>
	<p>Every card in the deck has two important properties:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>
		<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><b>Rank:</b> There are thirteen
		ranks. These are, in ascending order: Ace (A), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
		10, Jack (J), Queen (Q), and King (K). Aces have the unique property
		that they're either the highest- or lowest-ranked card. </p>
	  </li>
	  <li>
		<p><b>Suit:</b> There are four suits: Hearts, Spades, Clubs, and
		Diamonds. Unlike with ranks, Video Poker doesn't attach any ordering to
		suits, i.e. Spades are not “worth” more than Hearts, or anything. All
		that matters with suits is whether all the cards in the hand have the
		same suit. </p>
	  </li>
	</ul>

	<p>Each &ldquo;game&rdquo; of video poker is very short. It follows
	these steps:</p>
	<ol>
	  <li>
		<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><b>The player makes a bet.</b> In
		this implementation, the currency is the abstract &ldquo;coin&rdquo; and you can
		pretend that is any currency or multiple you like - pennies, quarters,
		shekels, euros, or if you're a high roller, you can say that each coin
		represents five billion British Pounds (even allowing for the fact that
		the British billion is 1000 times the size of my native USA billion).
		Or you can play for bragging rights, or number of noogies you're
		allowed to give your kid brother. In any case, a bet is the first step,
		and it can be from one to five coins. The more coins you play, the
		higher the potential payoff, but also the faster you go through your
		supply. </p>
	  </li>
	  <li>
		<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><b>The computer deals five cards to
		the player.</b> A set of five cards constitutes a &ldquo;hand&rdquo;. At this
		point, as a courtesy, the computer analyzes the hand and reports
		whether it is a winning hand. If so, it displays what kind. Winning
		hands are shown below. </p>
	  </li>
	  <li>
		<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><b>The player chooses cards to hold.</b>
		Video Poker is a species of &ldquo;draw&rdquo; poker, in which the player is
		allowed to discard some or all of the initially-dealt cards and get new ones dealt,
		if it seems likely to improve the hand to do so. Cards which are not discarded are &ldquo;held&rdquo;. It is also
		OK to hold all the cards, if the initial deal happens to be favorable.
		(This situation, holding all the cards, is known as a &ldquo;pat hand&rdquo;.) </p>
	  </li>
	  <li>
		<p><b>Cards not held get replaced by new cards from the deck.</b>
		This action is known as &ldquo;drawing&rdquo;. A new hand is thus formed. </p>
	  </li>
	  <li>
		<p><b>The computer analyzes the new hand</b> and, if it's a winning
		hand, pays the player the appropriate number of coins. </p>
	  </li>
	</ol>
</td>
<td class="sidebar">
	<p>In short, the idea is this. Get a hand, decide if your payoff is likely
	to improve by discarding certain cards, then get paid or not based on
	the results of your decision. For a game that's so simple, it's
	amazingly compelling, and it involves some strategy. Said strategy is
	outside the scope of this project - there are a bazillion web pages
	out there that describe it, though be warned: many of them are of the
	&ldquo;see how many popups we can litter the screen with&rdquo;
	type. </p></td>
